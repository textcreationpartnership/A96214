            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And that is my Rule; and this denyes not Scriptures, but opens them, when to all thy learned they are as a Book ſealed; ſo they were to the chief Prieſts and Phariſees when Chriſt came in the fleſh; for with all their Hebrew, Greek and Latine, they could not know him, as thou mayeſt ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.14, 15. for they had their ſaying who he ſhould be; and when he asked his Diſciples, they were ſilent, ſave he who had a revelation, who had a revelation, who ſaid he was the ſon of the living God: And there is no other knowing of him now ſavingly, nor never was, though falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles or Miniſters may transform themſelves as the Miniſters of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whoſe end ſhall be according to their works, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.15. as thine is, for under thy Miniſtry groweth bryars, and thorns, and ſtubble; and no marvel, for they that God ſent not, ſhall not profit the people at all, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.32. <hi>For by their fruits ye ſhall know them,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.15, 16. where he bids us beware of them, <hi>Bleſſed be his Name that their marks they cannot blot out.</hi> Now read and confider theſe lines I pray thee, before the Lord, and look into thy conſcience for the Lords ſake, that thou mayeſt not deſtroy thy ſelf and the ſouls of them that hear thee; and remember thou haſt been warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a friend to thy ſoul.</p>

            <p>Having read in ſome Papers of your zeal in promoting the Goſpel of Chriſt; it is good to be zealouſly affected alwayes in a good matter: But O ye Rulers, ſee you to your matter,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.3.</note> for there is a way that ſeems right to a man, but the end thereof is death; and there may be a zeal, but not according to knowledge. And there is a name to things,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.9.</note> but the things are not ſo as they are named. And there may be that called Goſpel, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched for it, and it not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Now let them be accurſed that preaches it; but be you free, and be not partakers of other mens ſins, that both you and the Nations may be freed from the plagues of <hi>Babylon;</hi> for if you ſupport her not, ſhe cannot ſtand;<note place="margin">

            <p>Now in love to you and the truth, for whoſe ſake <hi>I</hi> am moved to write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that all may read and ſearch the Scriptures of truth,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Acts</hi> 9.1 <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1</note> Now before <hi>Paul</hi> knew Chriſt to be in him, he perſecuted him; but when it pleaſed God to reveal his Son in him, he preached him in the world whom the world knew not, but was to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118836:8"/>them a myſtery, as he is this day where he is not believed on in them; for the Antichriſtian Miniſtry hath preacht him up in Heaven of a diſtance from man,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Therefore take heed my dear Friends, and now Rulers, what Goſpel you do promote, and what Miniſtry you do ſet up, for the Spirit of Life, which is the Lord, is riſen in our hearts, and he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into his Witneſſes,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.11. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8.</note> which is the Light of Chriſt, and ſpirit of men; and the time is at hand that the dead ſhould be judged, and the man of ſin revealed and conſumed, and the glory of all fleſh to be ſtained, &amp; the Star of <hi>Jacob</hi> to be exalted, who is riſen in our hearts, and ariſing in many thouſands; that the kingdom of this world may become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, whoſe day is at hand. Therefore fall away from the man of ſin, which is in the Temple your body, that the day of Chriſt you may ſee, for that day ſhall not come except there come a falling away firſt, &amp; the man of ſin be revealed, which is that in you that oppoſeth the Light of Chriſt and his Miniſtry, and exalteth it ſelf, which muſt be conſumed before the glory of the Lord be revealed in you,<note place="margin">
